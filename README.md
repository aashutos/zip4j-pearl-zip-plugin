# Pearl Zip
#### By Aashutos Kakshepati
A front-end application wrapper for the 7zip and other compression libraries written using JavaFX 15. Aiming for stable 
release with OpenJDK Java 17 LTS. Currently, the application is in its Pre-Alpha phase and so is considered unstable. 
The aim going forward is to release a more stable application with sufficient regression test coverage and bug fixes 
to stabilise and sure-up the application.
